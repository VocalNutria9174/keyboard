This directory contains the HTML, JS, and CSS files for a Keyboard Test page.

The test page allows you to type characters and see the keys light up on an
on-screen keyboard. The page assumes the user has a QWERTY layout keyboard.
You can change the on-screen keyboard layout from QWERTY to DVORAK using the
dropdown.

See the test page here:

TODO: Figure out how to get this working with github pages.
